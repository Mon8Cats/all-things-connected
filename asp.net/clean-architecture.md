# ASP.NET Core MVC with Clean Architecture

Clean Architecture is a software design pattern that emphasizes separation of concerns by organizing code into layers. It ensures that the business logic remains independent of UI, infrastructure, and external dependencies. This makes the application maintainable, scalable, and testable.

## Layers of Clean Architecture

- Domain Layer
  - Entities, Business Rules 
- Application Layer
  - CQRS, DTOs, Interfaces
- Infrastructure Layer
  - Database, API Integrations, Repositories
- Presentation Layer
  - Controllers, Views, ViewModels

## Benefits of Clean Architecture

- Scalability: Easily extend application without affecting core logic.
- Maintainability: Separation of concerns makes code easy to update.
- Testability: Unit tests can be written for each layer independently.
- Flexibility: Swap infrastructure components (e.g., replace EF Core with Dapper).
