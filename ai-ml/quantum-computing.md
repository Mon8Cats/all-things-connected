# Quantum Computing

How Quantum Computing Works
Quantum computing is based on the principles of quantum mechanics, which allow it to perform certain types of computations much faster than classical computers. Here’s how it works:

Qubits Instead of Bits

Classical computers use bits (0s and 1s).
Quantum computers use qubits, which can exist in a state of 0, 1, or both simultaneously due to superposition.
Superposition

A qubit can be in a state of 0 and 1 at the same time.
This allows quantum computers to process multiple calculations simultaneously.
Entanglement

When two qubits are entangled, their states are correlated no matter how far apart they are.
This allows quantum computers to perform complex calculations more efficiently.
Quantum Interference

Quantum computers use interference to amplify correct answers and cancel out incorrect ones.
Quantum Gates

Classical computers use logic gates (AND, OR, NOT).
Quantum computers use quantum gates, which manipulate qubits using quantum mechanics principles.


Differences Between Quantum and Classical Computing
Feature	Classical Computing	Quantum Computing
Basic Unit	Bits (0 or 1)	Qubits (0, 1, or both at the same time)
Processing Power	Performs one operation at a time	Processes multiple operations in parallel (due to superposition)
Data Representation	Binary representation (discrete states)	Uses probability distributions (continuous states)
Logic Gates	Traditional logic gates (AND, OR, NOT)	Quantum gates (Hadamard, CNOT, Toffoli)
Performance	Efficient for deterministic tasks	Best for complex, probabilistic problems
Security	Vulnerable to brute-force attacks	Can enhance cryptography (e.g., Shor’s algorithm for breaking RSA)
Computing Power Growth	Limited by Moore’s Law	Scales exponentially for certain problems
