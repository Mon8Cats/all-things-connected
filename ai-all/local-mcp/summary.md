# Local MCP

Let's get you started building a local "My Custom Python" (MCP) environment leveraging Ollama and VS Code. It sounds like you want a setup where you can interact with and potentially build applications using language models locally within your development environment.

Here are the steps and tools you'll need:

Core Tools:

Python: You'll need Python installed on your system. It's likely you already have it if you're planning to use it for your MCP.

Installation: Download the latest version from the official Python website ([search query 1: "download python latest version"]).
Verification: Open your terminal or command prompt and run python --version or python3 --version to confirm it's installed.
Ollama: This is the engine that allows you to run large language models locally on your machine.

Installation: Visit the official Ollama website ([search query 2: "ollama installation"]) and follow the instructions for your operating system (macOS, Linux, Windows - currently in preview).
Verification: Once installed, open a new terminal and run ollama --version to check if it's working. You should see the version number.
VS Code (Visual Studio Code): This will be your integrated development environment (IDE) for writing and managing your Python code.

Installation: Download VS Code from the official website ([search query 3: "download visual studio code"]).
Verification: After installation, open VS Code.
Python Libraries (Install via pip):

You'll likely need some Python libraries to interact with Ollama and build your custom application. Here are some common ones you might find useful:

requests: This library is essential for making HTTP requests to the Ollama API. You'll use it to send prompts to the language models and receive responses.
Bash

pip install requests
streamlit or gradio (Optional but Recommended for a User Interface): If you want to create a simple web interface to interact with your local LLM, these libraries are excellent choices.
Bash

pip install streamlit
# or
pip install gradio
Other Libraries: Depending on what you want your MCP to do, you might need other libraries (e.g., for data processing, file handling, specific application logic).
Steps to Build Your Local MCP:

Install Core Tools:

Follow the installation instructions for Python, Ollama, and VS Code as mentioned above.
Start Ollama:

Open a new terminal or command prompt and run the command ollama serve. This will start the Ollama background service. Keep this terminal window open while you're working with Ollama.
Pull a Language Model in Ollama:

In another terminal window, use the ollama pull command to download a language model that you want to use. For example, to download the llama2 model:
Bash

ollama pull llama2
You can find a list of available models on the Ollama website or by using the ollama list command once you have some models. Other popular options include mistral, codellama, etc.
Set Up Your VS Code Project:

Open VS Code.
Create a new folder for your MCP project (e.g., local_mcp).
Open this folder in VS Code (File > Open Folder).
Create a new Python file (e.g., main.py).
Write Python Code to Interact with Ollama:

In your main.py file, you'll use the requests library to send API calls to Ollama. Here's a basic example:

Python

import requests
import json

def query_ollama(model, prompt):
    url = "http://localhost:11434/api/generate"
    data = {
        "model": model,
        "prompt": prompt,
        "stream": False  # Set to True for streaming responses
    }
    try:
        response = requests.post(url, data=json.dumps(data))
        response.raise_for_status()  # Raise an exception for bad status codes
        return response.json()['response']
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print(f"Error communicating with Ollama: {e}")
        return None

if __name__ == "__main__":
    model_name = "llama2"  # Change this to the model you pulled
    user_prompt = input("Enter your prompt: ")
    output = query_ollama(model_name, user_prompt)
    if output:
        print("\nOllama Output:")
        print(output)
Explanation:

We import the requests and json libraries.
The query_ollama function takes the model name and a prompt as input.
It constructs the URL for the Ollama /api/generate endpoint (default is http://localhost:11434).
It creates a JSON payload with the model, prompt, and stream parameters.
It sends a POST request to the Ollama API.
It handles potential network errors using a try-except block.
It parses the JSON response and returns the generated text.
The if __name__ == "__main__": block gets user input, calls the query_ollama function, and prints the output.
Run Your Python Code:

Save your main.py file.
Open a new terminal within VS Code (Terminal > New Terminal).
Make sure your Ollama server is still running in the other terminal.
Run your Python script using:
Bash

python main.py
Enter a prompt when asked, and you should see the response from the Ollama model.
(Optional) Build a User Interface with Streamlit or Gradio:

If you installed streamlit, create a new Python file (e.g., app.py) and write code like this:

Python

import streamlit as st
import requests
import json

def query_ollama(model, prompt):
    url = "http://localhost:11434/api/generate"
    data = {
        "model": model,
        "prompt": prompt,
        "stream": False
    }
    try:
        response = requests.post(url, data=json.dumps(data))
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.json()['response']
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        st.error(f"Error communicating with Ollama: {e}")
        return None

st.title("Local MCP with Ollama")
model_name = st.selectbox("Select Model", ["llama2"]) # Add more models if you've pulled them
prompt = st.text_area("Enter your prompt:")

if st.button("Generate"):
    if prompt:
        with st.spinner("Generating..."):
            output = query_ollama(model_name, prompt)
        if output:
            st.subheader("Ollama Output:")
            st.write(output)
    else:
        st.warning("Please enter a prompt.")
Save app.py and run it from your terminal using:

Bash

streamlit run app.py
This will open a web browser with a simple interface to interact with your local LLM.

You can do something similar with gradio.

Further Development:

From this basic setup, you can expand your local MCP in many ways:

Experiment with different Ollama models: Try mistral, codellama, or others.
Implement different Ollama API parameters: Explore options like temperature, top_p, num_predict, etc., to control the generation process.
Build more complex applications: Integrate the LLM into your Python projects for tasks like text generation, code completion, data analysis, and more.
Create more sophisticated user interfaces: Enhance your Streamlit or Gradio app with more features.
Manage different prompts and outputs: Store and organize your interactions with the LLM.
Troubleshooting Tips:

Ollama Server Not Running: Ensure you have the ollama serve command running in a separate terminal.
Incorrect API Endpoint: Double-check the URL (http://localhost:11434/api/generate).
Model Not Found: Make sure you have successfully pulled the specified model using ollama pull.
Network Errors: Check your network connection if you encounter issues communicating with Ollama.
JSON Errors: Ensure your Python code is correctly encoding the data as JSON.
By following these steps, you'll have a foundational local MCP environment using Python, Ollama, and VS Code. You can then build upon this base to create whatever custom application you envision. Good luck!














### test
It sounds like you're envisioning a system where you have multiple "My Custom Python" (MCP) servers, each potentially offering different models, tools, or resources. You want a central "MCP agent" or host that can intelligently route your queries to the most suitable MCP server based on the content of your query.

Here's a breakdown of the concepts and steps involved in configuring such a system:

1. Defining Your MCP Servers and Their Capabilities (The "MCP JSON File"):

Your "MCP JSON file" will act as a registry of your available MCP servers and their capabilities. The structure of this file is crucial. Here's a suggested format:

JSON

{
  "mcp_servers": [
    {
      "name": "code_generation_server",
      "host": "http://localhost:8001",
      "description": "Server optimized for code generation tasks.",
      "models": ["codellama", "starcode"],
      "tools": ["code_completion", "syntax_checking"],
      "resources": ["python_documentation", "javascript_documentation"],
      "keywords": ["code", "programming", "scripting", "develop"]
    },
    {
      "name": "general_text_server",
      "host": "http://localhost:8002",
      "description": "General-purpose language model server.",
      "models": ["llama2", "mistral"],
      "tools": ["text_generation", "translation", "summarization"],
      "keywords": ["text", "writing", "information", "general knowledge"]
    },
    {
      "name": "data_analysis_server",
      "host": "http://localhost:8003",
      "description": "Server with models and tools for data analysis.",
      "models": ["llama2"],
      "tools": ["data_querying", "basic_analysis"],
      "resources": ["pandas_documentation", "numpy_documentation"],
      "keywords": ["data", "analysis", "statistics", "numbers"]
    }
    // ... more servers
  ]
}
name: A unique identifier for the MCP server.
host: The network address (URL) of the MCP server.
description: A brief description of the server's purpose.
models: A list of the language models available on this server (assuming it's using Ollama or a similar service).
tools: A list of specific tools or functionalities this server offers (e.g., custom Python scripts, specific APIs).
resources: A list of relevant data sources or documentation accessible by this server.
keywords: A list of keywords that describe the types of queries this server is best suited for.
2. Building the MCP Agent/Host (Python):

Your central Python script will act as the agent that reads the mcp.json file and routes queries. Here's a conceptual outline and code snippets:

Python

import json
import requests

def load_mcp_config(filepath="mcp.json"):
    """Loads the MCP server configuration from the JSON file."""
    try:
        with open(filepath, 'r') as f:
            config = json.load(f)
            return config.get("mcp_servers", [])
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Error: {filepath} not found.")
        return []
    except json.JSONDecodeError:
        print(f"Error: Could not decode JSON from {filepath}.")
        return []

def find_best_server(query, mcp_servers):
    """
    Analyzes the query and finds the most relevant MCP server based on keywords.
    This is a basic example; you can implement more sophisticated logic.
    """
    best_server = None
    max_keyword_matches = 0

    query_lower = query.lower()
    query_keywords = query_lower.split() # Simple keyword extraction

    for server in mcp_servers:
        matches = 0
        if "keywords" in server:
            for keyword in server["keywords"]:
                if keyword in query_keywords or keyword in query_lower:
                    matches += 1

        if matches > max_keyword_matches:
            max_keyword_matches = matches
            best_server = server

    return best_server

def forward_query(query, server_config):
    """Forwards the query to the selected MCP server and returns the response."""
    if not server_config or "host" not in server_config:
        print("Error: No suitable server found or server configuration is incomplete.")
        return None

    api_endpoint = f"{server_config['host']}/your_query_endpoint" # Define your API endpoint on MCP servers
    payload = {"query": query}

    try:
        response = requests.post(api_endpoint, json=payload)
        response.raise_for_status()  # Raise an exception for bad status codes
        return response.json()
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print(f"Error communicating with {server_config['name']} ({server_config['host']}): {e}")
        return None

if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp_servers = load_mcp_config()

    if not mcp_servers:
        print("No MCP servers configured. Exiting.")
    else:
        user_query = input("Enter your query: ")
        best_server = find_best_server(user_query, mcp_servers)

        if best_server:
            print(f"Forwarding query to: {best_server['name']} ({best_server['host']})")
            response = forward_query(user_query, best_server)
            if response:
                print("\nResponse from MCP Server:")
                print(response)
        else:
            print("No suitable MCP server found for your query.")
3. Configuring Your Individual MCP Servers:

Each of your individual MCP servers (running Ollama and your custom Python code) needs to have an API endpoint that can receive queries from the central agent.

Example (using Flask on an MCP server):

Python

from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import subprocess

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/your_query_endpoint', methods=['POST'])
def handle_query():
    data = request.get_json()
    query = data.get('query')

    if not query:
        return jsonify({"error": "Missing 'query' in request"}), 400

    # Process the query using local Ollama or other tools
    try:
        ollama_process = subprocess.run(
            ['ollama', 'run', 'llama2', query], # Example using Ollama directly
            capture_output=True,
            text=True,
            check=True
        )
        response = ollama_process.stdout.strip()
        return jsonify({"response": response})
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        return jsonify({"error": f"Ollama error: {e.stderr}"}), 500

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8001, debug=True) # Example port
You would need to adapt the handle_query function on each MCP server to utilize its specific models, tools, and resources based on the received query.
4. Running the System:

Start each of your individual MCP servers (e.g., by running the Flask application or your custom server scripts on their respective hosts and ports).
Run your central MCP agent script (main.py in the example above).
Enter your query when prompted by the agent.
The agent will analyze the query, select the most appropriate MCP server based on the mcp.json configuration, and forward the query to that server.
The selected MCP server will process the query and send the response back to the agent, which will then display it to you.
Further Considerations and Enhancements:

More Sophisticated Server Selection: Instead of simple keyword matching, you could use more advanced techniques like:
Natural Language Understanding (NLU): Use a small local NLU model to understand the intent and entities in the query and match them to server capabilities.
Semantic Similarity: Embed the query and the descriptions/keywords of each server and find the most semantically similar server.
Load Balancing and Health Checks: For a more robust system, you might want to implement load balancing across similar servers and health checks to ensure servers are online and functioning correctly.
API Design for MCP Servers: Define a consistent API contract for all your MCP servers to make communication easier for the agent. This might include different endpoints for different types of requests (e.g., /generate, /execute_tool).
Authentication and Authorization: If your MCP servers handle sensitive data or operations, you'll need to implement security measures.
Dynamic Server Registration: Instead of a static mcp.json file, you could have a mechanism for MCP servers to register themselves with the central agent dynamically.
Error Handling and Fallback Mechanisms: Implement robust error handling in the agent and consider fallback strategies if the primary server is unavailable or doesn't provide a satisfactory response.
By implementing these steps and considering the enhancements, you can build a flexible and intelligent system where a central agent can effectively manage and utilize multiple local MCP servers based on the nature of your queries. Remember to tailor the mcp.json structure and the server selection logic to your specific needs and the capabilities of your MCP servers.
