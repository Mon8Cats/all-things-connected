Let's dig in
Help yourself. Enjoy your meal.
My mouth is watering
Is it good?
It's finger-licking good
It's my comfort food.
It melts in my mouth.

I have a cough, fever, a runny nose, a stuffy nose, a migraine, chills, 
    cold sweats, no appetite, 

I book a suite.
Can I get a wake-up call
where is the front desk?
Could you call the bellman?
I have one carry-on.
