- Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc : one event precedes another -> causation? no
- Appeal to Ignorance : true before proven to be false ? no
- Appeal to Nature : natural is good? no
- Appeal to Popularity : popular is good? no 
- Guilt by Association : false because it shared by a bad group? no
- No True Scotsman : blame bad group, or counter examples
- Fallacy of Composition : true of parts -> true of whole?
- Fallacy of Division : true of whole -> true of all parts?
- Appeal to Hypocrisy : attack the person's inconsistency
