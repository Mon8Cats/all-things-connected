## How to Use in Azure DevOps
1. **Create Epics**: In Azure Boards, create Epics under the "Work Items" section. Assign titles and descriptions as listed above.  
2. **Add Features**: Link Features as child items to their respective Epics using the "Add Link" option.  
3. **Create User Stories**: Add User Stories as child items of Features. Include acceptance criteria and story points in the work item form.  
4. **Break Down Tasks**: Add Tasks as child items of User Stories. Assign tasks to team members and estimate effort.  
5. **Manage Backlogs**: Use the "Backlogs" view to prioritize Epics, Features, and User Stories. Drag and drop to set priorities.  
6. **Plan Sprints**: Assign User Stories and Tasks to sprints in the "Sprints" view. Use the Taskboard to track progress.  
7. **Track Progress**: Use Kanban boards to visualize work item states (e.g., New, Active, Closed). Update statuses as work progresses.  
8. **Monitor Dependencies**: Use Predecessor/Successor links for dependent tasks (e.g., backend APIs before frontend development).  
9. **Use Dashboards**: Create dashboards to monitor velocity, burndown charts, and work item status.

## Best Practices
- **Clear Titles and Descriptions**: Ensure work item titles are concise and descriptions provide enough detail for estimation.[](https://ittechgenie.com/AzureDevOps/WorkItemsEpicsFeaturesUserStories)
- **Define Acceptance Criteria**: Include clear acceptance criteria for User Stories to ensure completion standards are met.[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/boards/work-items/guidance/agile-process-workflow?view=azure-devops)
- **Break Down Work**: Divide large Features into manageable User Stories and Tasks to fit within sprints.[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/boards/backlogs/define-features-epics?view=azure-devops)
- **Regular Backlog Grooming**: Review and prioritize the backlog weekly to keep it aligned with project goals.[](https://ittechgenie.com/AzureDevOps/WorkItemsEpicsFeaturesUserStories)
- **Use Story Points**: Estimate User Stories using story points to forecast sprint capacity and velocity.[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/boards/work-items/guidance/agile-process-workflow?view=azure-devops)
- **Track Dependencies**: Use Azure Boardsâ€™ dependency tracking to manage cross-team dependencies.[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/boards/best-practices-agile-project-management?view=azure-devops)
