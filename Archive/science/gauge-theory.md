# Gauge theory

A gauge theory is a type of quantum field theory that describes the fundamental forces and elementary particles in nature.The physical laws described by the theory remain unchanged under certain transformations of the fields (gauge transformations).

## Concepts

- Symmetry:
- Fields: elementary particles (bosons) as excitation of underlying quantum fields.
- Gauge Transformations: transformations of the fields that do not alter the observable physical quantities.
- Gauge Invariance: equations of motion and physical predictions are unaffected by gauage transformations.
- Gauge Bosons: to ensure that a theory remains gauge invariant even when the transformations vary from point to point in spacetime (local gauge symmetry), new force carrying particles called gauge bosons must be introduced.
- U(1), SU(3), SU(2)XU(1)
- equation -> transformation -> break symmetry? -> add Gauge Field -> restore symmetry -> force particle?
