## Query Store

The Query Store in SQL Server is a feature that acts like a flight data recorder for your database. Introduced in SQL Server 2016, it automatically captures a history of queries, execution plans, and runtime statistics, and retains this information for your review.   

Here's a breakdown of what it is and why it's important:

What it does:

Captures Query History: It records the text of SQL queries that are executed against a database.   
Stores Execution Plans: For each query, it stores the execution plans that were used. This includes both the initial plan and any subsequent plans that the query optimizer generates.   
Tracks Runtime Statistics: It collects data on the performance of queries over time, such as execution count, duration, CPU time, memory consumption, and I/O operations.   
Persists Data: Unlike the plan cache, which is cleared when the SQL Server instance restarts, Query Store data is persisted on disk within the database where it's enabled.
Organizes by Time Windows: It separates the collected data into time windows, allowing you to analyze performance trends over specific periods.   
Key Benefits of Using Query Store:

Performance Troubleshooting: Quickly identify and fix performance regressions caused by query plan changes. If a query suddenly starts performing poorly after a deployment or an automatic plan change, you can use Query Store to see the previous, better-performing plan and potentially force SQL Server to use it again.   
Plan Stability: You can enforce the use of a specific execution plan for a query. This is useful for critical queries where consistent performance is essential and you want to prevent the optimizer from choosing a suboptimal plan in the future.
Identifying Top Resource Consuming Queries: Determine which queries are using the most CPU, memory, or I/O resources over a given period. This helps in identifying candidates for optimization.   
A/B Testing: Compare the performance of queries before and after code changes, index modifications, or database upgrades.   
Historical Analysis: Analyze query performance trends over time to understand database usage patterns and identify potential bottlenecks.   
Auditing Query Plan Changes: Track the history of execution plans for a specific query.   
Understanding Wait Statistics: In later versions of SQL Server (2017 and above), Query Store also captures wait statistics at the query level, helping you understand what resources queries are waiting on.   
Informed Tuning: Provides data-driven insights to guide your query tuning efforts, such as identifying missing indexes or inefficient query patterns.   
How to Enable Query Store:

You can enable Query Store for a specific database using either SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) or Transact-SQL (T-SQL).   

Using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS):

In Object Explorer, right-click on the database you want to enable Query Store for.
Select Properties.
In the Database Properties dialog box, select the Query Store page.
Change the Operation Mode (Requested) to Read Write.
Configure other settings as needed (e.g., Max Size (MB), Query Capture Mode, Stale Query Threshold (Days)).   
Click OK.
Using Transact-SQL (T-SQL):

Open a new query window and execute the following command, replacing <database_name> with the actual name of your database:

SQL

ALTER DATABASE <database_name>
SET QUERY_STORE = ON (OPERATION_MODE = READ_WRITE);
You can also configure other options within the SET QUERY_STORE command, such as:

SQL

ALTER DATABASE <database_name>
SET QUERY_STORE = ON (
    OPERATION_MODE = READ_WRITE,
    DATA_FLUSH_INTERVAL_SECONDS = 900, -- How often data is written to disk (default: 900 seconds/15 minutes)
    MAX_STORAGE_SIZE_MB = 1024,       -- Maximum size of the Query Store in MB (default: 100 MB)
    QUERY_CAPTURE_MODE = AUTO,        -- Determines which queries are captured (ALL, AUTO, NONE)
    SIZE_BASED_CLEANUP_MODE = AUTO,   -- Enables automatic cleanup based on size
    STALE_QUERY_THRESHOLD_DAYS = 30   -- Retention period for inactive queries (default: 30 days)
);
In summary, the Query Store is a valuable tool for database administrators and developers to understand query performance over time, troubleshoot regressions, and ensure consistent and efficient database operations.

Learn to use ORDER BY, GROUP BY, and HAVING clauses effectively.
Understand Joins:
Master the different types of joins: INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL OUTER JOIN.
Visualize how joins combine data from multiple tables.
Practice writing joins with different conditions.
Aggregate Functions and Grouping:
Learn to use aggregate functions like COUNT(), SUM(), AVG(), MIN(), and MAX().
Understand how GROUP BY and HAVING work together to summarize data.
Subqueries and Common Table Expressions (CTEs):
Learn to use subqueries to nest queries within other queries.
Learn about CTEs (WITH clauses) for easier to read and maintain complex queries.
3. Data Manipulation and Database Design:

Learn Data Modification:
Practice using INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements.
Understand how to use WHERE clauses to target specific rows.
Be cautious when deleting or updating data, as these operations can have significant consequences.
Basic Database Design:
