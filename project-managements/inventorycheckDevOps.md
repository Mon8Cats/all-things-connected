-------
Azure DevOps Organization
To implement this in Azure DevOps:

Create Epics: Add the six epics as parent work items in Azure DevOps.
Add Features: Link features as child work items under their respective epics.
Add User Stories: Link user stories as child work items under their respective features.
Set Acceptance Criteria: Define acceptance criteria in each user story for clear requirements.
Track Progress: Use Azure DevOps boards to assign, prioritize, and track work items (e.g., using sprints or Kanban).
Link to Code: Associate user stories with code commits, pull requests, and builds for traceability.

Notes

Prioritization: Prioritize Epics 6 (infrastructure) and 2 (authentication) early, as they are foundational.
Iteration: Break user stories into tasks in Azure DevOps for smaller, actionable work items.
Testing: Add tasks for unit tests (e.g., for CQRS handlers, validators) and integration tests (e.g., for DbContext, File Service).
Validation: Use the Repository Specification Pattern (e.g., ISpecification) for querying data in user stories like filtering inventory checks.
