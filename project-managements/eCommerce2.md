# eCommerce Site Project Planning

## Epics

An Epic represents a large, strategic goal or initiative that can be broken down into smaller, manageable chunks. Epics often span multiple sprints and are high-level.

## Features

A Feature is a distinct, customer-facing piece of functionality that delivers value. Each feature should relate back to a specific Epic.

## User Stories

A User Story describes a specific piece of functionality from the perspective of an end-user. It follows the format: "As a [type of user], I want to [goal], so that [reason]." User stories are the core of the development work and are contained within a Feature.

## Task 

A Task is a specific, actionable piece of work required to complete a User Story. Tasks are typically technical and assigned to individual team members. They should be small enough to be completed within a short time frame, usually a few hours to a day.
