# Is Gravity Force?

## What is weight?

Weight is force acting on my body due to the pull of gravity.
Gravitational force depends on the mass of object that generating the force (the Earth).
Weight - force - which direction?
Mass - scalar - number
Gravitation is not a force
Gravity is not described as a force but rather as a curvature of spacetime.
Massive object cause a distortion in the fabric of spacetime.
The curvature affects the motion of objects, which move along paths called geodesics

There is no force action on the mass.
The mass is just navigating the curved spacetime.
We cannot see the curve but can see the effect.

The Equivalence Principle : 
    the local effect of gravity as same as the effect of acceleration.
