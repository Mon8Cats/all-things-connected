# Category Theory

## Limits and Colimits

| Concept | Limit | Colimit |
| :---:   | :---: | :---: |
| Intuition | Combine while preserving constraints | Combine freely |
| Examples | Product, Pullback, Equalizer | Coproduct, Pushout, Coequalizer |
| Sets | Cartesian product A x B | Disjoint union A + B |
| Groups | Direct product G x H | Free product G * H |
| Set Theory | Intersection, Cartesian product | Union, Disjoint union |
| Logic | Universal quantification | Existential quantification |
| Topology | Pullback of spaces | Gluing spaces |
| Algebra | Kernel, Fibered product | Cokernel, Amalgamated sum |
| Type Theory | Tuples, Dependent Types | Sum Types, Unions |
| Mathematics | preserve constraints | merge things freely |
| Category Theory | complete | cocomplete |
