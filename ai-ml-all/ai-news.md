## AI - World Model

- understanding physical laws?

## MBRL (model-based reinforcement learning)

## Diffusion and Auto-regression

Deep Neural Network
Curve fitting tasks
Prediction - Curve fitting?
Blurring Image - Many Labels - Average of Labels 
Image with parts of missing - predict missing parts?
Introduce Random Sampling?
Auto-regression - it takes too long (one pixel a time)
average - blurring effect 
remove unrelated pixels
removing , add back-ins
instead of removing + adding noise -> ?
scale down the original image and add noise
de-nosing diffusion?
Optimizations?
Casual Architecture?
Casual Con-volution Architecture
Diffuse noise

    math framework: 
        category theory provides the blueprint for structured knowledge
        complexity theory explains how this structure can emerge dynamically and autonomously.
    from relatively simple iterative process.
