PraisonAI is a production-ready Multi-AI Agents framework with self-reflection, designed to create AI Agents to automate and solve problems ranging from simple tasks to complex challenges. By integrating PraisonAI Agents, AG2 (Formerly AutoGen), and CrewAI into a low-code solution, it streamlines the building and management of multi-agent LLM systems, emphasising simplicity, customisation, and effective human-agent collaboration.
